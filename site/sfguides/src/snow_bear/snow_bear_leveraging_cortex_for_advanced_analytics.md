# Snow Bear Fan Experience Analytics - Leveraging Cortex for Advanced Analytics
<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Customer experience analytics is crucial for businesses to understand their customers and improve their services. Through comprehensive data analysis and AI-powered insights, businesses can uncover patterns in customer feedback, identify pain points, and generate actionable recommendations.

In this Quickstart, we will build a comprehensive fan experience analytics platform for a basketball team called "Snow Bear". This demonstrates how to use Snowflake Cortex AI functions to analyze fan survey data, extract sentiment insights, generate business recommendations, and create advanced analytics dashboards.

This Quickstart showcases the complete Snow Bear analytics platform with:
- **7-module interactive analytics platform** with Executive Dashboard, Fan Journey Explorer, Sentiment Analysis, Theme Analysis, Recommendation Engine, Interactive Search, and AI Assistant
- **AI-powered sentiment analysis** across 8 feedback categories
- **Advanced theme extraction** and automated categorization
- **Cortex Search Service** for semantic search
- **Cortex Analyst integration** for natural language queries
- **500+ basketball fan survey responses**

## Setup Snowflake Environment  

In this step, you'll create the Snowflake database objects and upload all necessary files for the Snow Bear analytics platform.

### Step 1: Create Database Objects

> aside positive
> 
> Starting in September 2025, Snowflake is gradually upgrading accounts from Worksheets to [Workspaces](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/workspaces). Workspaces will become the default SQL editor. Follow the instructions below that match your interface.

**To use Workspaces:**
1. In Snowsight, click `Projects`, then `Workspaces` in the left navigation
2. Click `+ Add new` to create a new Workspace
3. Click `SQL File` to create a new SQL file
4. Copy the setup script from [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) and paste it into your SQL file, then run it

**To use Worksheets:**
1. In Snowsight, click `Projects`, then `Worksheets` in the left navigation
2. Click `+` in the top-right corner to open a new Worksheet
3. Copy the setup script from [setup.sql](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/scripts/setup.sql) and paste it into your worksheet, then run it

The setup script creates:
- **Database**: `SNOW_BEAR_DB` with `BRONZE_LAYER`, `GOLD_LAYER`, and `ANALYTICS` schemas
- **Role**: `SNOW_BEAR_DATA_SCIENTIST` with all necessary permissions  
- **Warehouse**: `SNOW_BEAR_WH` for compute resources
- **Stages**: `SNOW_BEAR_STAGE` (in ANALYTICS) for app/data files and `SEMANTIC_MODELS` (in GOLD_LAYER) for AI assistant
- **File Format**: `CSV_FORMAT` for data loading
- **AI Access**: `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER` role for Cortex functions

### Step 2: Download Required Files

Download these 5 files from the GitHub repository:

| File | Purpose | Download Link |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Data File** | Basketball fan survey data | [basketball_fan_survey_data.csv.gz](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/scripts/basketball_fan_survey_data.csv.gz) |
| **Streamlit App** | Interactive analytics dashboard | [snow_bear.py](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/scripts/snow_bear.py) |
| **Environment File** | Streamlit dependencies | [environment.yml](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/scripts/environment.yml) |
| **Semantic Model** | AI assistant semantic model | [snow_bear_fan_360.yaml](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/scripts/snow_bear_fan_360.yaml) |
| **Notebook** | Setup and data processing notebook | [snow_bear_complete_setup.ipynb](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-snow-bear-fan-experience-analytics-leveraging-cortex/blob/main/notebooks/snow_bear_complete_setup.ipynb) |

### Step 3: Upload Files to Stages

1. In Snowsight, change your role to `SNOW_BEAR_DATA_SCIENTIST`

2. Navigate to `Catalog` → `Database Explorer` → `SNOW_BEAR_DB`

**Upload files to two stages in different schemas:**

3. **Upload to `ANALYTICS` → `Stages` → `SNOW_BEAR_STAGE`:**
   - Navigate to `ANALYTICS` → `Stages`
   - Click on `SNOW_BEAR_STAGE`
   - Click `Enable Directory Table`
   - Upload these files:
     - `basketball_fan_survey_data.csv.gz`
     - `snow_bear.py`
     - `environment.yml`

4. **Upload to `GOLD_LAYER` → `Stages` → `SEMANTIC_MODELS`:**
   - Navigate to `GOLD_LAYER` → `Stages`
   - Click on `SEMANTIC_MODELS`
   - Click `Enable Directory Table`
   - Upload this file:
     - `snow_bear_fan_360.yaml`

### Step 4: Import the Analytics Notebook

1. **Import into Snowflake**:
   - Navigate to `Projects` → `Notebooks` in Snowsight
   - Click the down arrow next to `+ Notebook` and select `Import .ipynb file`
   - Choose `snow_bear_complete_setup.ipynb` from your downloads

2. **Configure the notebook settings**:
   - **Role**: Select `SNOW_BEAR_DATA_SCIENTIST`
   - **Database**: Select `SNOW_BEAR_DB`
   - **Schema**: Select `ANALYTICS`  
   - **Query Warehouse**: Select `SNOW_BEAR_WH`
   - **Notebook Warehouse**: Select `SNOW_BEAR_WH`

4. **Click `Create`** to import the notebook

The notebook contains all the SQL scripts and processing logic needed for the complete analytics platform.
